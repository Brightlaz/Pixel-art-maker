## Description

I built a single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas!
It is a project on Udacity junior front-end developer nano-degree program

## Process
The app uses the width and app provided by the user to create a customizable canvas using table element 
Then, the app allows the user to give a back-ground color to any box[tr] using the color he or she chose in the color palette
Finally, when the submit button is clicked a new customizable canvas is created

## Dependency
I used a starter code containing only the html and css files provided by udacity for the projects
The js file[designs.js] was built from scratch by me
